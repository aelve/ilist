Note: a lot of these functions are available for other types (in their respective packages):

  * @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector/docs/Data-Vector.html Data.Vector>@ provides 'indexed' and lots of other functions beginning with “i”.

  * @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Map-Lazy.html Data.Map>@ and @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Sequence.html Data.Sequence>@ provide similar functions, but use a different naming convention (e.g. @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Map-Lazy.html#v:mapWithKey mapWithKey>@ for maps and @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Sequence.html#v:foldrWithIndex foldrWithIndex>@ for sequences).

  * <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> provides several typeclasses for indexed functions that work on maps, lists, vectors, bytestrings, and so on (in @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens/docs/Control-Lens-Indexed.html Control.Lens.Indexed>@), but unfortunately they are pretty slow for lists.

{- Left to do:

* a README with benchmarks
* say that there's no documentation for functions because see their versions in Data.List
* write that the order for foldl is like this because it's like this in vector and containers
* link from microlens to this
* link from my site to this
* ask someone whether I need rules that rewrite versions with build back into versions without build
